# Deep-Learning-for-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* etc. 

## Project Description
The dataset used for this study consists of real estate sale prices in King County, USA, and includes attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, location, and more. Also, two different model architectures were utilized in this case study. The initial model consisted of five dense layers with varying numbers of neurons. The final architecture included three dense layers with 10 neurons each, followed by an output layer with one neuron for price prediction. The activation function used was ReLU for the hidden layers and linear for the output layer.

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
